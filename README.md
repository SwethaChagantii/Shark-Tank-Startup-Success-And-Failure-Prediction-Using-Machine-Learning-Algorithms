# SHARK TANK - STARTUP SUCCESS AND FAILURE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS

## Abstract
Startups are the growth indicators of a country. Growing startups are a good opportunity for investors to get high returns in less time and less capital. In the competitive world of startups, predicting success is crucial for strategic decision-making. With 90% of startups facing challenges, employing robust methods to forecast success is essential. This study leverages Machine Learning algorithms like AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest to evaluate key performance indicators. AdaBoost stands out with a predictive accuracy of 78%, highlighting its effectiveness. Using extensive historical data, our models offer insights into the factors influencing startup success, guiding stakeholders and investors in making informed decisions.

## Introduction
In today's fast-paced world, startups are the backbone of innovation and economic growth. However, the high failure rate of startups is a significant challenge. Predicting the success of startups can provide invaluable insights for investors and stakeholders, helping them make informed decisions. This project focuses on developing a predictive model using Machine Learning algorithms to forecast the success and failure of startups.

## Existing System
- Predicts operational status of the company [“Operating”, “Acquired”, “Closed”, & “IPO”]
- First, modified k-means clustering is used to pre-train the model and group data according to feature similarity
- Then, grouped data is being used with the ANN for training and prediction of the startup's success
- Limitations: Cannot handle noisy data, less generalizability and accuracy

## Algorithms Used
The project utilizes the following Machine Learning algorithms:
- **AdaBoost:** It iteratively corrects the errors of the weak classifiers by giving more weight to the misclassified data points.
- **Gradient Boosting:** It sequentially trains multiple weak models to correct errors made by preceding models, optimizing a differentiable loss function.
- **Random Forest:** It builds multiple decision trees and merges their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

## Advantages
- **Informed Decision Making:** Provides data-driven insights for investors.
- **High Predictive Accuracy:** Utilizes advanced ML algorithms to achieve high accuracy.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Helps in identifying high-risk investments.
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Considers multiple factors influencing startup success.
- **Mitigation of Overfitting:** Ensemble methods effectively handle complex data relationships and reduce overfitting
